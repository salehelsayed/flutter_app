     * Required for `flutter_local_notifications` on `singleTask` apps.
     *
     * On Android, when `launchMode="singleTask"` (see `AndroidManifest.xml`),
     * a notification-tap PendingIntent is delivered to `onNewIntent` on the
     * existing MainActivity instance instead of starting a fresh Activity.
     * The default `FlutterActivity.onNewIntent` does NOT call
     * `setIntent(intent)`, so the new intent's extras (including the
     * `flutter_local_notifications` plugin's notification-response payload)
     * are silently dropped before the plugin's
     * `onDidReceiveNotificationResponse` dispatcher can see them.
     *
     * Calling `setIntent(intent)` here makes the new intent visible to the
     * Flutter embedding's plugin pipeline, which then dispatches
     * `didReceiveNotificationResponse` to the Dart side and the
     * `NOTIFICATION_TAPPED` flow event finally fires.
     *
     * Diagnosed in the Pixel ↔ iOS-sim hardware soak on 2026-05-05; see
     * `Test-Flight-Improv/Group-Chat-Feature/lock-window-fix-followups-tdd-plan-2026-05-04.md`
     * (section "2026-05-05 hardware-soak finding"). Standing Rule 2.1 in the
     * same document requires a real-device hardware soak to verify — that is
     * the runtime regression catcher; the matching Dart pin test
     * (`test/core/notifications/main_activity_onnewintent_pin_test.dart`) is
     * the static catcher.
